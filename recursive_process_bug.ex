The following code snippet demonstrates a common error in Elixir when working with processes and recursion:

```elixir
 defmodule RecursiveProcess do
  def start_link(count) do
    spawn(fn -> loop(count) end)
  end

  defp loop(0) do
    :ok
  end

  defp loop(count) do
    IO.puts("Count: #{count}")
    loop(count - 1)
  end
 end

RecursiveProcess.start_link(5)
```

This code will likely cause a stack overflow error because the recursive `loop/1` function is called within the same process.  Each recursive call adds a new stack frame, and the stack is not designed for extremely deep recursion.

The problem is exacerbated in Elixir due to the lightweight nature of processes.  While processes don't share memory, they still rely on the Erlang VM's process scheduler and memory management.  Deep recursion within a single process still consumes stack space.
